With over a decade of experience as an engineer, I served as the CTO of Yourator, leading the product team to deliver exceptional solutions. I am deeply passionate about frontend development, combining design and technology to create software with outstanding user experiences that effectively address real-world problems.

In addition to my focus on frontend development, I am experienced at integrating data analysis and user feedback to provide a solid foundation for strategic product decisions. I firmly believe that the value of technology lies not only in solving problems but also in closely aligning with user needs, ensuring every feature delivers meaningful impact.
