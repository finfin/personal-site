Flowcharts are a powerful form of diagram that use a few simple elements to illustrate the sequence of events, possible branches, and more. They help readers focus on **"what will happen next and the sequential relationships between each part of the process."**

Flowcharts can be applied in various scenarios, such as reviewing incidents, planning system functionalities, or even organizing trips and events.

## Basic Symbols of a Flowchart

Here is an introduction to the basic elements commonly found in flowcharts:

1. **Start and End (Start/End):**
    Used to mark the beginning or end of a process.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-1.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Start/End Symbol" />
    </div>

2. **Process:**
    Represents a single step within the process.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-2.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Process Symbol" />
    </div>
3. **Predefined Process:**
   Indicates a subprocess or detailed flow defined elsewhere.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-3.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Predefined Process Symbol" />
    </div>
4. **Delay:**
   A step that requires waiting.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-5.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Decision Symbol" />
    </div>
5. **Decision:**
   Represents a decision or branching point, leading to different paths.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-4.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Delay Symbol" />
    </div>
6. **Preparation/Initialization:**
   A step involving preparation or initialization.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-6.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Preparation/Initialization Symbol" />
    </div>
7. **Input/Output:**
   Marks the input or output of data.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-7.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Input/Output Symbol" />
    </div>
8. **Manual Input:**
   Indicates a step requiring human interaction, such as manual input or operation.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-8.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Manual Input Symbol" />
    </div>

9. **AND/OR:**
   Logical operators used to combine or branch process flows.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-9.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="AND/OR Symbol" />
    </div>
10. **Document/Multiple Documents:**
    Represents a document or a set of documents.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-10.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Document/Multiple Document Symbol" />
    </div>
11. **Database:**
    Denotes a system used for storing data, especially in software contexts.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-11.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Database Symbol" />
    </div>
12. **Connector/Off-page Connector:**
    Used when there isn’t enough space to continue the flow.
    - **Connector:** Used for connections on the same page.
    - **Off-page Connector:** Used for linking to a flow on a different page.
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-12.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Connector/Off-page Connector Symbol" />
    </div>
13. **Arrow:**
    The core of a flowchart, showing the next step in the process. Typically, arrows point forward. Dotted lines may be used for annotations or indirect references to another symbol or explanatory block.

    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[4/1]">
      <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-13.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Arrow Symbols" />
    </div>
With these symbols, you can create clear and effective flowcharts for a variety of purposes!


## Usage Examples

Here are two examples showcasing how these icons can be applied:

### Login Process

<div className="relative w-full h-150">
  <Image src="/images/posts/flowchart-introduction-en-example-1.png" fill className="object-contain" alt="Example: Login Process" />
</div>

### Recruitment Process

<div className="relative w-full h-100">

## Flowchart for Better Problem-Solving

Powerful tools like draw.io offer built-in flowchart symbols, making them feature-rich but often accompanied by a steeper learning curve. In contrast, simpler and more intuitive tools like Whimsical and Excalidraw require users to create their own symbol libraries, offering greater flexibility but requiring a bit of setup.

Since I personally rely on Excalidraw for creating flowcharts, all the symbols featured in this article were drawn using it. If you’re an Excalidraw user as well, I’ve created a [Flow Chart Symbols library](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/?theme=light&sort=default#finfin-flow-chart-symbols) that you can explore. Give it a try, and I’d love to hear your feedback to make it even better!

Flowcharts make it easier to visualize the entire picture, and Excalidraw’s intuitive design simplifies the process of creating and refining these visualizations. By clearly mapping out processes, we can quickly identify and focus on areas that require improvement or fixing, leaving more time for deeper problem-solving and generating insights. This makes it an invaluable tool for enhancing clarity and driving effective solutions.
