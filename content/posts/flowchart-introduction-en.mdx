Flowcharts are a powerful form of diagram that use a few simple elements to illustrate the sequence of events, possible branches, and more. They help readers focus on **"what will happen next and the sequential relationships between each part of the process."**

Flowcharts can be applied in various scenarios, such as reviewing incidents, planning system functionalities, or even organizing trips and events.

## Basic Symbols of a Flowchart

Here is an introduction to the basic elements commonly found in flowcharts:

1. **Start and End (Start/End):**
    Used to mark the beginning or end of a process.

2. **Process:**
    Represents a single step within the process.

9. **AND/OR:**
   Logical operators used to combine or branch process flows.

10. **Document/Multiple Documents:**
    Represents a document or a set of documents.

11. **Database:**
    Denotes a system used for storing data, especially in software contexts.

12. **Connector/Off-page Connector:**
    Used when there isn’t enough space to continue the flow.
    - **Connector:** Used for connections on the same page.
    - **Off-page Connector:** Used for linking to a flow on a different page.

13. **Arrow:**
    The core of a flowchart, showing the next step in the process. Typically, arrows point forward. Dotted lines may be used for annotations or indirect references to another symbol or explanatory block.

## Flowchart for Better Problem-Solving

Powerful tools like draw.io offer built-in flowchart symbols, making them feature-rich but often accompanied by a steeper learning curve. In contrast, simpler and more intuitive tools like Whimsical and Excalidraw require users to create their own symbol libraries, offering greater flexibility but requiring a bit of setup.

Since I personally rely on Excalidraw for creating flowcharts, all the symbols featured in this article were drawn using it. If you’re an Excalidraw user as well, I’ve created a [Flow Chart Symbols library](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/?theme=light&sort=default#finfin-flow-chart-symbols) that you can explore. Give it a try, and I’d love to hear your feedback to make it even better!

Flowcharts make it easier to visualize the entire picture, and Excalidraw’s intuitive design simplifies the process of creating and refining these visualizations. By clearly mapping out processes, we can quickly identify and focus on areas that require improvement or fixing, leaving more time for deeper problem-solving and generating insights. This makes it an invaluable tool for enhancing clarity and driving effective solutions.
